# Digit-Recognizer-From-Hand-Gesture

## A model to recognize digits from hand gesture using CNN

### Technologies Used-

    • Keras API
    
    • Tensorflow Backend
    
    • OpenCv

Model achieved an accuracy of about 96%

Dataset Link- https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset 

**Few samples of images are also taken from user through file Dataset_creation.ipynb using OpenCv.**

### Mainly There are Three files in repo:
  * Dataset_creation.ipynb : To create custom Dataset using OpenCv.
  * Model.ipynb: It cantains the model which is build using CNN.
  * Prediction.ipynb: To detect digits from hand gesture
